# Description

* *Deployed Application*: <https://main--hirex5709.netlify.app/>

Collaborated with a team of six to design and develop HireX, providing simplified job posting, candidate tracking, and comprehensive interview tools for recruiters, interviewers, and candidates. I have developed and integrated two key features from scratch, Pre-Interview Evaluation and Interview Schedule Management, leveraging Spring Boot, React, MaterialUI, and MongoDB. Utilized github-api from org.kohsuke to create new repositories for project evaluation tasks and dynamically add interviewers and candidates as collaborators from the Spring Boot backend application.
